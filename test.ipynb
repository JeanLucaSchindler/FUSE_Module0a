The wonders never cease, for those who devote their eyes to suchwondering. How we have made everything around us so bright and easyand free and simple! How we have given our senses a carte blanche for ev- erything superﬁcial, given our thoughts a divine craving for high-spiritedleaps and false inferences! – How we have known from the start to holdon to our ignorance in order to enjoy a barely comprehensible freedom,thoughtlessness, recklessness, bravery , and joy in life; to delight in lifeitself ! And, until now , science could arise only on this solidiﬁed, granitefoundation of ignorance, the will to know rising up on the foundation of amuch more powerful will, the will to not know , to uncertainty , to untruth!Not as its opposite, but rather – as its reﬁnement! Even when language , here as elsewhere, cannot get over its crassness and keeps talking aboutopposites where there are only degrees and multiple, subtle shades ofgradation; even when the ingrained tartuffery of morals (which is nowpart of our “ﬂesh and blood,” and cannot be overcome) twists the wordsin our mouths (we who should know better); now and then we still realize what is happening, and laugh about how it is precisely the best science that will best know how to keep us in this simpliﬁed , utterly artiﬁcial, \\uf731In German: der freie Geist .

Not to mention the absurd spectacle ofmoral indignation, which is an unmistakable sign that a philosopher haslost his philosophical sense of humor. The philosopher’s martyrdom, his “self-sacriﬁce for the truth,” brings to light the agitator and actor in him;and since we have only ever regarded him with artistic curiosity , it is easyto understand the dangerous wish to see many of these philosophers intheir degeneration for once (degenerated into “martyrs” or loud-mouthson their stage or soap-box). It’s just that, with this sort of wish we have tobe clear about what we will be seeing: – only a satyr-play , only a satirical epilogue, only the continuing proof that the long, real tragedy has come to an end (assuming that every philosophy was originally a long tragedy – ). \\uf732\\uf736 Every choice human being strives instinctively for a citadel and secrecy where he is rescued from the crowds, the many , the vast majority; where, as the exception, he can forget the human norm. The only exception iswhen he is driven straight towards this norm by an even stronger instinct,in search of knowledge in the great and exceptional sense. Anybody who,in dealing with people, does not occasionally glisten in all the shades ofdistress, green and gray with disgust, weariness, pity , gloominess, andloneliness – he is certainly not a person of higher taste. But if he does not freely take on all this effort and pain, if he keeps avoiding it and remains,as I said, placid and proud and hidden in his citadel, well then one thingis certain: he is not made for knowledge, not predestined for it. Becauseif he were, he would eventually have to say to himself: “To hell withgood taste! The norm is more interesting than the exception – than me,the exception!” – and he would wend his way downwards , and, above all, “inwards.” The long and serious study of the average man requires a great deal of disguise, self-overcoming, conﬁdentiality , bad company (all com-pany is bad company except with your equals); still, this is all a necessarypart of the life story of every philosopher, perhaps the least pleasant, mostfoul-smelling part and the one richest in disappointments. But if he islucky , as beﬁts knowledge’s child of fortune, the philosopher will ﬁnd real shortcuts and aids to make his work easier. I mean he will ﬁnd so-calledcynics – people who easily recognize the animal, the commonplace, the “norm” within themselves, and yet still have a degree of spiritedness and \\uf732\\uf737',\n",

Cynicism isthe only form in which base souls touch upon that thing which is genuinehonesty . And the higher man needs to open his ears to all cynicism, crudeor reﬁned, and congratulate himself every time the buffoon speaks upwithout shame, or the scientiﬁc satyr is heard right in front of him. Thereare even cases where enchantment mixes with disgust: namely , wheregenius, by a whim of nature, is tied to some indiscreet billy-goat andape, like the Abb ´e Galiani, the most profound, discerning, and perhaps also the ﬁlthiest man of his century . He was much more profound thanV oltaire, and consequently a lot quieter. But, as I have already suggested,what happens more often is that the scientiﬁc head is placed on an ape’sbody , a more subtle and exceptional understanding is put in a base soul.This is not a rare phenomenon, particularly among physicians and phys-iologists of morals. And wherever even one person is speaking about manwithout any bitterness but instead quite innocuously , describing him as astomach with dual needs and a head with one; wherever someone sees andseeks and wants to see only hunger, sex-drive and vanity , as if these were the sole and genuine motivating forces of human action; in short, whereversomebody is speaking “badly” of people – and not even wickedly – this is where the lover of knowledge should listen with subtle and studious atten-tion. He should keep his ears open wherever people are speaking withoutanger. Because the angry man, and anyone who is constantly tearing andshredding himself with his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, orGod, or society), may very well stand higher than the laughing and self-satisﬁed satyr, considered morally . But considered in any other way , heis the more ordinary , more indifferent, less instructive case. And nobodylies as much as the angry man. – \\uf732\\uf737 It is hard to be understood, particularly when you think and live gangasro- togati\\uf734among people who think and live differently , namely kurmagati\\uf735or at best “walking like frogs,” mandeikagati (am I doing everything I can to be hard to understand myself ?), and you should give heartfelt thanks for \\uf734Sanskrit for “as the current of the [river] Ganges moves.” \\uf735Sanskrit for “as the tortoise moves.” \\uf732\\uf738',\n",

But as far as “good friends” are concerned, they are always too easy-going and think that theyhave a right to be easy-going, just because they are friends. So it is best togrant them some leeway from the very start, and leave some latitude formisunderstandings: – and then you can even laugh. Or, alternatively , getrid of them altogether, these good friends, – and then laugh some more! \\uf732\\uf738 The hardest thing to translate from one language into another is thetempo of its style, which is grounded in the character of the race, or – tobe more physiological – in the average tempo of its “metabolism.” There are well-meaning interpretations that are practically falsiﬁcations; theyinvoluntarily debase the original, simply because it has a tempo that cannotbe translate d – a tempo that is brave and cheerful and leaps over and out of every danger in things and in words. Germans are almost incapable ofapresto in their language: and so it is easy to see that they are incapable of many of the most delightful and daring nuances of free, free-spiritedthought. Since the buffo and the satyr are alien to the German in body and in conscience, Aristophanes and Petronius are as good as untranslatable.Everything ponderous, lumbering, solemnly awkward, every long-windedand boring type of style is developed by the Germans in over-abundantdiversity . Forgive me for pointing out that even Goethe’s prose, with itsmixture of the stiff and the delicate, is no exception; it is both a reﬂectionof the “good old days” to which it belonged and an expression of the German taste back when there still was a “German taste”: it was a Rococo taste, in moribus et artibus . \\uf736Lessing is an exception, thanks to his actor’s nature that understood and excelled at so much. He was not the translatorof Bayle for nothing; he gladly took refuge in the company of Diderot andV oltaire, and still more gladly among the Roman writers of comedy . Evenin tempo, Lessing loved free-thinking \\uf737and the escape from Germany . But how could the German language – even in the prose of a Lessing –imitate Machiavelli’s tempo – Machiavelli who, in his Principe , \\uf738lets us breathe the ﬁne, dry air of Florence?

What do all the swamps of the sick and wicked world – even the “ancient world” – matter in the end for someone like him, with feet of wind, with the breath andthe force and the liberating scorn of a wind that makes everything healthyby making everything run! And as for Aristophanes, that transﬁguring, complementary spirit for whose sake we can forgive the whole Greek world for existing (as long as we have realized in full depth and profundity what needs to be forgiven and transﬁgured here): – nothing I know has givenme a better vision of Plato’s secrecy and Sphinx nature than that happily preserved petit fait : \\uf739under the pillow of his deathbed they did not ﬁnd a “Bible” or anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic – but instead, Aristophanes.

He entersa labyrinth, he multiplies by a thousand the dangers already inherent inthe very act of living, not the least of which is the fact that no one witheyes will see how and where he gets lost and lonely and is torn limb fromlimb by some cave-Minotaur of conscience.

The distinc- tion between the exoteric and the esoteric, once made by philosophers,was found among the Indians as well as among Greeks, Persians, andMuslims. Basically , it was found everywhere that people believed in anorder of rank and not in equality and equal rights. The difference be- tween these terms is not that the exoteric stands outside and sees, values,measures, and judges from this external position rather than from someinternal one. What is more essential is that the exoteric sees things up frombelow – while the esoteric sees them down from above!

It seems as if the wrath andreverence that characterize youth will not rest easy until they have falsiﬁed people and things thoroughly enough to be able to vent themselves onthese targets. Y outh is itself intrinsically falsifying and deceitful. Later,after the young soul has been tortured by constant disappointments, itends up turning suspiciously on itself, still raging and wild, even in theforce of its suspicion and the pangs of its conscience. How furious itis with itself now , how impatiently it tears itself apart, what revenge itexacts for having blinded itself for so long, as if its blindness had beenvoluntary! In this transitional state, we punish ourselves by distrusting our feelings, we torture our enthusiasm with doubts, we experience even a good conscience as a danger, as if it were a veil wrapped around us,something marking the depletion of a more subtle, genuine honesty . And,above all, we become partisan, partisan on principle against “youth.” – A decade later, we realize that all this – was youthfulness too! \\uf733\\uf732 During the longest epoch of human history (which is called the prehistoricage) an action’s value or lack of value was derived from its consequences;the action itself was taken as little into account as its origin. Instead,the situation was something like that of present-day China, where thehonor or dishonor of a child reﬂects back on the parents. In the sameway , it was the retroactive force of success or failure that showed peo-ple whether to think of an action as good or bad. W e can call this pe-riod the pre-moral period of humanity . At that point, the imperative “know thyself !” was still unknown. By contrast, over the course of the lastten millennia, people across a large part of the earth have gradually comefar enough to see the origin, not the consequence, as decisive for thevalue of an action. By and large, this was a great event, a consider-able reﬁnement of outlook and criterion, an unconscious after-effect of thedominance of aristocratic values and the belief in “origin,” and the sign of a period that we can signify as moral in a narrow sense. This marks the ﬁrst attempt at self-knowledge. Origin rather than consequence: what areversal of perspective! And, certainly , this reversal was only accomplishedafter long struggles and ﬂuctuations!

The origin of the action was interpreted in the most determinatesense possible, as origin out of an intention . People were united in the be- lief that the value of an action was exhausted by the value of its intention.Intention as the entire origin and prehistory of an action: under this pre-judice people have issued moral praise, censure, judgment, and philoso-phy almost to this day . – But today , thanks to a renewed self-contemplationand deepening of humanity , shouldn’t we be facing a renewed necessityto effect a reversal and fundamental displacement of values? Shouldn’twe be standing on the threshold of a period that would be designated,negatively at ﬁrst, as extra-moral ? Today , when we immoralists, at least, suspect that the decisive value is conferred by what is speciﬁcally unin- tentional about an action, and that all its intentionality , everything about it that can be seen, known, or raised to “conscious awareness,” only be- longs to its surface and skin – which, like every skin, reveals somethingbutconceals even more? In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign and symptom that ﬁrst needs to be interpreted, and that, moreover,it is a sign that means too many things and consequently means almostnothing by itself. W e believe that morality in the sense it has had up to now(the morality of intentions) was a prejudice, a precipitousness, perhapsa preliminary , a thing on about the same level as astrology and alchemy ,but in any case something that must be overcome. The overcoming ofmorality – even the self-overcoming of morality , in a certain sense: let this be the name for that long and secret labor which is reserved for the mostsubtle, genuinely honest, and also the most malicious consciences of theday , who are living touchstones of the soul. – \\uf733\\uf733 There is nothing else to be done: the feelings of utter devotion, of sacriﬁcefor your neighbor, and the entire morality of self-abnegation have tobe mercilessly taken to court and made to account for themselves. Andthe same holds for the aesthetic of “disinterested contemplation,” theseductive guise under which the castration of art is presently trying tocreate a good conscience for itself. These feelings of “for others,” of“not for myself,” contain far too much sugar and sorcery for us not to need to become doubly suspicious here and ask: “ Aren’t these perhaps –seductions ?” To say that these feelings are pleasing (for the one who has \\uf733\\uf733',\n",

In all seriousness, there is something touching and awe-inspiringabout the innocence that, to this day , lets a thinker place himself in frontof consciousness with the request that it please give him honest answers: for example, whether or not it is “real,” and why it so resolutely keepsthe external world at arm’s length, and other questions like that.

But there is no doubtthat when it comes to discovering certain aspects of the truth, people who are evil and unhappy are more fortunate and have a greater probabilityof success (not to mention those who are both evil and happy – a species that the moralists don’t discuss). Perhaps harshness and cunning providemore favorable conditions for the origin of the strong, independent spiritand philosopher than that gentle, ﬁne, yielding good nature and art oftaking things lightly that people value, and value rightly , in a scholar.Assuming ﬁrst of all that we do not limit our notion of the “philosopher” to the philosophers who write books – or put their own philosophy into books! – One last feature for the picture of the free-spirited philosopher \\uf733\\uf737',\n",
       " 14: 'Beyond Good and Evil is provided by Stendhal; and for the sake of the German taste, I will not overlook the chance to underscore this character – since it goes against the German taste. “ Pour ˆ etre bon philosophe ,” says this last, great psychologist, “il faut ˆ etre sec, clair, sans illusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du caract` ere requis pour faire des d´ ecouvertes en philosophie, c’est-` a-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est .”\\uf731\\uf735 \\uf734\\uf730 Everything profound loves masks; the most profound things go so far as to hate images and likenesses. W ouldn’t just the opposite be a proper disguise for the shame of a god? A questionable questio n: it would be odd if some mystic hadn’t already risked something similar himself. There are events that are so delicate that it is best to cover them up with some coarsenessand make them unrecognizable. There are acts of love and extravagantgenerosity in whose aftermath nothing is more advisable than to take astick and give the eye-witnesses a good beating: this will obscure anymemory traces. Many people are excellent at obscuring and abusing theirown memory , so they can take revenge on at least this one accessory: –shame is highly resourceful. It is not the worst things that we are the mostashamed of. Malicious cunning is not the only thing behind a mask –there is so much goodness in cunning. I could imagine that a man withsomething precious and vulnerable to hide would roll through life, roughand round like an old, green, heavy-hooped wine cask; the subtlety of hisshame will want it this way . A man with something profound in his shameencounters even his fate and delicate decisions along paths that few peoplehave ever found, paths whose existence must be concealed from his closestand most trusted friends. His mortal danger is hidden from their eyes,and so is his regained sense of conﬁdence in life. Somebody hidden in thisway – who instinctively needs speech in order to be silent and concealed, and is tireless in evading communication – wants and encourages a mask of himself to wander around, in his place, through the hearts and heads ofhis friends. And even if this is not what he wants, he will eventually realizethat a mask of him has been there all the same, – and that this is for the best. \\uf731\\uf735“To be a good philosopher you have to be dry , clear, and without illusions. A banker who has made a fortune has to a certain degree the right sort of character for making philosophical discoveries, i.e. for seeing clearly into what is.” From Stendhal’s Correspondance in´ edite (Unedited Correspon- dence )(\\uf731\\uf738\\uf735\\uf735 ). \\uf733\\uf738',\n",
       " 15: 'The free spirit Every profound spirit needs a mask: what’s more, a mask is constantly growing around every profound spirit, thanks to the consistently false(which is to say shallow ) interpretation of every word, every step, every sign of life he displays. – \\uf734\\uf731 W e have to test ourselves to see whether we are destined for independenceand command, and we have to do it at the right time. W e should notsidestep our tests, even though they may well be the most dangerousgame we can play , and, in the last analysis, can be witnessed by no judgeother than ourselves. Not to be stuck to any person, not even somebodywe love best – every person is a prison and a corner. Not to be stuck in any homeland, even the neediest and most oppressed – it is not as hardto tear your heart away from a victorious homeland. Not to be stuck insome pity: even for higher men, whose rare torture and helplessness weourselves have accidentally glimpsed. Not to be stuck in some ﬁeld ofstudy: however much it tempts us with priceless discoveries, reserved, itseems, for us alone. Not to be stuck in our own detachment, in the ecstasyof those foreign vistas where birds keep ﬂying higher so that they can keepseeing more below them: – the danger of those who ﬂy . Not to be stuck toour own virtues and let our whole self be sacriﬁced for some one of ourdetails, our “hospitality ,” for instance: this is the danger of dangers for rich souls of a higher type, who spend themselves extravagantly , almostindifferently , pushing the virtue of liberality to the point of vice. W e mustknow to conserve ourselves : the greatest test of independence. \\uf734\\uf732 A new breed of philosophers is approaching. I will risk christening them with a name not lacking in dangers. From what I can guess about them,from what they allow to be guessed (since it is typical of them to want to remain riddles in some respect), these philosophers of the future mighthave the right (and perhaps also the wrong) to be described as those who attempt . \\uf731\\uf736Ultimately , this name is itself only an attempt, and, if you will, a temptation. \\uf731\\uf736In German: Versucher . Nietzsche frequently uses the terms Versuch (attempt or experiment) and Versuchung (temptation), and plays on their similarity . \\uf733\\uf739',\n",
       " 16: 'Beyond Good and Evil \\uf734\\uf733 Are they new friends of “truth,” these upcoming philosophers? Probably , since all philosophers so far have loved their truths. But they certainlywill not be dogmatists. It would offend their pride, as well as their taste, iftheir truth were a truth for everyone (which has been the secret wish andhidden meaning of all dogmatic aspirations so far). “My judgment is my judgment: other people don’t have an obvious right to it too” – perhapsthis is what such a philosopher of the future will say . W e must do away withthe bad taste of wanting to be in agreement with the majority . “Good”is no longer good when it comes from your neighbor’s mouth. And howcould there ever be a “common good”! The term is self-contradictory:whatever can be common will never have much value. In the end, it has tobe as it is and has always been: great things are left for the great, abyssesfor the profound, delicacy and trembling for the subtle, and, all in all,everything rare for those who are rare themselves. – \\uf734\\uf734 After all this, do I really need to add that they will be free, very free spirits, these philosophers of the future – and that they certainly will notjust be free spirits, but rather something more, higher, greater, and funda- mentally different, something that does not want to be misunderstoodor mistaken for anything else? But, in saying this, I feel – towards themalmost as much as towards ourselves (who are their heralds and precursors,we free spirits!) – an obligation to sweep away a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding about all of us that has hung like a fog aroundthe concept of the “free spirit” for far too long, leaving it completely opaque. In all the countries of Europe, and in America as well, there isnow something that abuses this name: a very narrow , restricted, chained-up type of spirit whose inclinations are pretty much the opposite of ourown intentions and instincts (not to mention the fact that this restrictedtype will be a fully shut window and bolted door with respect to theseapproaching new philosophers). In a word (but a bad one): they belong to thelevelers , these misnamed “free spirits” – as eloquent and proliﬁcally scribbling slaves of the democratic taste and its “modern ideas.” Theyare all people without solitude, without their own solitude, clumsy , solidfolks whose courage and honest decency cannot be denied – it’s just thatthey are un-free and ridiculously superﬁcial, particularly given their basic \\uf734\\uf730',\n",

Whatthey want to strive for with all their might is the universal, green pasturehappiness of the herd, with security , safety , contentment, and an easier lifefor all. Their two most well-sung songs and doctrines are called: “equalrights” and “sympathy for all that suffers” – and they view suffering itself as something that needs to be abolished . W e, who are quite the reverse, have kept an eye and a conscience open to the question of where and how the plant “man” has grown the strongest, and we think that this has alwayshappened under conditions that are quite the reverse. W e think that thedanger of the human condition has ﬁrst had to grow to terrible heights,its power to invent and dissimulate (its “spirit” –) has had to developunder prolonged pressure and compulsion into something reﬁned anddaring, its life-will has had to be intensiﬁed to an unconditional power-will.

Is it any wonder that we “free spirits” arenot exactly the most communicative spirits? That we do not want to fullyreveal what a spirit might free himself from and what he will then perhaps be driven towards ? And as to the dangerous formula “beyond good and evil,” it serves to protect us, at least from being mistaken for somethingelse.
